    * Go to your newly-created fork of the repo (on GitHub).
    * Click `Clone or download` (the green button on the right).
    * Make sure the page says `Clone with SSH` (rather than `Clone with HTTPS`).
    * Open your git client (e.g. GitKraken) and use this link to clone the repo.  
      Your trainer will be able to help you with this.

1. "Cloning the repo" will create a folder on your computer with the files from this repo.  
   Open this folder in VSCode.

1. Make sure you've got PostgreSQL and pgAdmin installed. You'll need to set up a user and a database for this project.
   All instructions for this step are in the `Setting up Postgres` section below.

1. Open a command-prompt in the project directory (the directory containing `DuckDuckGoose.csproj`).  
   Your trainer can show you how to do this, if you need any help.

1. Run `dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef` to install the `dotnet-ef` tool if you haven't already

1. Run `dotnet ef database update` to run the migrations against the database

1. Run `dotnet run` to launch the app

1. The app should now be available at https://localhost:7151

If you get a security error when running the app, add and trust a self-signed certificate with `dotnet dev-certs https --trust`.

## Setting up PostgreSQL

Before you run the app you will need to make sure you've got PostgreSQL installed and a database set up.

### Installing PostgreSQL and pgAdmin

1. Download and install the [PostgreSQL server software](https://www.enterprisedb.com/downloads/postgres-postgresql-downloads) if you haven't already.

1. Open the Windows Start menu and search for "pgAdmin". When you start "pgAdmin" for the first time, you'll be asked to set a master password.

### Set up the DuckDuckGoose user

1. Inside your PostgreSQL server in pgAdmin, right-click on *Login/Group Roles* and create a new Login/Group Role with the name `duckduckgoose` (in the *General* tab), the password `duckduckgoose` (in the *Definition* tab) and the ability to log in and create databases (in the *Privileges* tab).

1. Click Save to create the user.

### Set up DuckDuckGoose database

1. Inside your PostgreSQL server in pgAdmin, right-click on *Databases* and create a new Database with the name `duckduckgoose` and the owner `duckduckgoose` (both in the *General* tab).

1. Click Save to create the database.
